This is the rubric for the Course 1 end-of-course project. The rubric was designed to be applicable to all of the project scenarios. You will use this rubric to review and grade your own work. The rubric grading process is an important part of the learning experience because it allows you to objectively assess your end-of-course project against a set of criteria.

There are a total of 14 points for the end-of-course project and 14 items in this rubric. Each rubric item is worth 1 point. The items are grouped by topic and correspond to each step you completed for the Course 1 end-of-course project. 

To use the rubric, first open your PACE strategy document and project proposal. Next, review each rubric item’s grading criteria. Then respond to each statement by marking “yes” or “no.”
